# Recycler View

In Kotlin, a RecyclerView is a user interface component used to display a list of items efficiently. It is part of the toolkit provided by Android for mobile application development. The RecyclerView is a more advanced and flexible version compared to its predecessor, ListView, as it offers optimized performance by reusing item views that are no longer visible on screen.
